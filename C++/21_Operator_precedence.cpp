// operator precence is like BODMMAS in CPP
// But we canm use brackets to give priority to an mathematical operation
// int devided by int will  give an integer valie i.e: 234/10 =23 (no decimal value will be printed)
// we can print the last digit of a number by taking a modulus of number by 10 i.e 246%10=6
